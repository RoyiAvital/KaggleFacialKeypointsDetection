# Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection

## Overview
Repository of data and solution (MATLAB Based) for [The Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection Competition][1].  
The solutions are using Regression Methods:
	1. 	Neural Network.
	2. 	Random Forests.
	3. 	SVM Regression.
	
With Feature Extraction phase:
	1. 	[The Histogram of Gradients (HoG) Feature][4].
	2.	[The Local Binary Pattern Feature][5].
	
## Repository Structure
TBC

## How to Run
TBC

## ToDo List
	1. 	Extend database (Translation).
	2.	Investigate why there are no gains by extending database using reflection of images.
	3. 	Create Feature Specialist Regressor per Keypoint.
