# Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection

## Overview
Repository of data and solution (MATLAB Based) for [The Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection Competition][001].  
The solutions are using Regression Methods:
 1. [Artificial Neural Network][002].
 2. [Random Forest][003].
 3. [SVM Regression][004].
	
With Feature Extraction phase:
 1. [The Histogram of Gradients (HoG) Feature][005].
 2. [The Local Binary Patterns Feature][006].
	
## Repository Structure

## ToDo List
List of tasks which might improve performance.
 1. Extend database (Translation).
 2. Investigate why there are no gains by extending database using reflection of images.
 3. Create Feature Specialist Regressor per Keypoint.
